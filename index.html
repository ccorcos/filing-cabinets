          <li>The databases we have today aren't well-suited for dynamic user-generated filters and sorts.</li>

              <p id="64d9a82d-8237-4a9f-b83f-eb9eae786157" class="">Underneath any end-user database is <em>another</em> database and so much complexity arises from the challenge of building a database inside a database. Solutions to this problem vary widely and make some sort of trade-off between scalability (performance) and complexity.</p>
              <p id="9dd2cc1a-1eb6-4af8-9c22-d486c3e9dc99" class="">Some applications load the entire end-user database in-memory. This creates long initial load times, but really performant interactions once the application loads. There are obvious scalability issues with this approach, but it is fairly simple to implement.</p>
              <p id="e10696df-1d8a-47ff-9365-701d9ff58d00" class="">Other applications resort to O(n) scans on the server to fetch data and filter/sort records in memory with a few caching and indexing optimizations when convenient. The problem here is that users can create their own columns and filters dynamically. If your cloud application is backed by a SQL database, for example, it‚Äôs worrisome to allow users to edit the database schema and create an unbounded number of tables and indexes. Thus, you must resort to filtering records in-memory.</p>
              <p id="30d92414-92a1-4469-99ba-643219826c94" class="">If you're dedicated to O(log n) queries, you'll need to build indexes yourself (unless there's some amazing database I am unaware of). On every write, you can compute what indexes need to be updated and you write to a NoSQL database to incrementally update a cached query result. This can lead to a good solution, but it comes at the cost of consistency. Now that you're building your own indexes outside of the database, writes are no longer transactional and you lose the guarantee of being able to read your own write.</p>
              <p id="c04b352e-bd9a-44ad-ba88-17ac5cc502ff" class="">Another solution is to have a separate database for every user and allow users to edit the schema of their own isolated database. This allows writes to be transactional, but creates other kinds of collision problems (i.e. dealing with merge conflict) when you want users to be able to collaborate. With separate databases for each user, you're also doing a lot more computing labor, especially if the same records are shared amongst many people.</p>
              <p id="7c45a3a9-7051-4386-a53f-d246c9ba7310" class="">Long story short, existing databases are not great for building end-user databases.</p>

        <p id="1d0ea7ea-6760-43cc-a728-4b3a1d7efe3b" class="">I'll introduce databases as an abstract concept and then we'll work through a real-world example to explore how databases leverage sorting and filters to lookup information quickly.</p>
        <p id="088e64ab-1cbd-49c2-85e5-ac16a93efcfa" class="">By the end, I hope to show you how these information architecture concepts are immensely powerful and totally approachable for non-technical people. </p>
        <p id="69cf1cd2-0e55-4a55-8d70-a407a8cba1e3" class="">Lastly, I want to convince you that software based on these concepts will be far superior to anything we use today for end-user database applications.

        <p id="9fb77909-54eb-4ecb-9059-10642f19e8f1" class="">Maybe this is just a one-time request so you can labor over it and be done with it, but the police chief says that every month he wants to mail a bonus check to every officer in the precinct with the most arrests.

To keep things simple, you photocopy all of the information in the <em>Badge #</em> cabinet over to the <em>Precinct</em> cabinet. Now when the chief asks you to get the address of every officer in a precinct, you can use this new filing cabinet to quickly retrieve the information.</p>
        <p id="484fc57d-3e3f-480f-96eb-3a437a385c83" class="">This new filing cabinet makes it easier for you to get information, but you've created a new problem every time you have to update the information.

This is still quicker than not having a <em>Precinct</em> cabinet, but not as fast as the previous approach for scanning through every officer's file.</p>

        <p id="a947ec18-40b8-47b3-8e28-4a121d059f1d" class="">For example, maybe you open up the file for Officer Jones and it says he is a detective.

And at our police department, changing any information might be documented with some kind of form. For example, when the police chief wants to promote Officer Jones to detective, he fills out a "promotion form" and delivers it to the filing clerk at the administration office.</p>

For example, we can look at all promotions by rank over time from the <em>Promotion Forms</em> cabinet. And if we wanted to determine when an officer was promoted, we can create a separate cabinet that sorts these promotion forms by badge number, then date.</p>

        <p id="1bd7a2db-998e-403e-b0b6-577beb25106b" class="">For example, suppose a bad actor wants to secretly add a record showing that Officer Jones was demoted on Dec 11 prior to being promoted on Dec 12 (perhaps to create a fraudulent scandal they can write about in the news to discredit the police chief before an election).</p>
        <p id="c0b940ef-6af8-4b19-a49f-131f3193c0dd" class="">Signatures are the first line of defense here. If a signature is hard to copy, then it will be hard to create a fraudulent demotion form (note: we're using the same promotion form for demotions as well). Another thing we can do is make note of the previous rank in the promotion form. That means if the bad actor wants to create this fraudulent demotion form, they will also need to fraudulently update the promotion form of Dec 12 to reference a previous demoted rank.</p>

        <p id="67cebce3-296c-49dd-9a31-0ff7c51cd38b" class="block-color-gray">Permissions, asynchronous communication, consistency, conflicts.</p>
        <p id="de29d4ea-832a-4852-8096-962407e7e117" class="">At this point, we've pretty much covered everything that is interesting about filing cabinets and how we can use them to manage large amounts of information with operational procedures. But there are a few more important systems needed for any realistic administration department.</p>
        <p id="e4c8f4a2-b5c3-4b3c-a574-413c49881a1d" class="">The first is managing permission. Who has permission to promote an officer? Who has permission to read the complaints on a given officer? And who has permission to change the address of an officer?</p>
        <p id="3ea81c61-2cf2-4b08-89af-2823c18a79c5" class="">There are plenty of ways to manage this and most organizations use some kind of permission hierarchy to keep things simple. I will leave answering these questions as an exercise for the reader, but if you are technically inclined, I would recommend reading about <a target="_blank" href="https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/">how Google solves this problem with their Zanzibar database</a>.</p>
        <p id="007e5a16-f824-46ff-98c3-d8adc579195e" class="">
        </p>
        <p id="5e51c04f-a566-4f9b-9862-6d2c1ab5ac93" class="">Another part of the system that needs to be carefully managed is how information gets mailed around to different departments. Sending something in the mail takes time which can cause all sorts of issues in a complex organization.</p>
        <p id="625425c1-549a-433a-95ed-0441a0d538bf" class="">For example, maybe an officer gets promoted on Dec 12 and when the finance department sends out paychecks on Dec 13, they still haven't received the promotion from the mail and so they send out a paycheck based on their previous rank.</p>
        <p id="70aa70b2-6306-4584-866c-4d21ecaef59e" class="">Things get even more challenging when coordination is involved. For example, maybe the HR department determines that an officer has too many complaints and must be demoted. The HR department sends the demotion in the mail to the administration department as well as the finance department. At the same time, the chief thinks that the officer should be promoted and sends a promotion in the mail to the administration department as well as the finance department. </p>
        <p id="6be14639-50e6-44fe-97f7-b371621847db" class="">Now what happens? Regardless of the outcome, the most important thing is that the administration, HR, and finance departments end up with the same result (also known as eventual consistency). For example, if the finance department decides to process the promotion and the administration department decides to process the demotion, then their records will differ and the officer will receive a larger paycheck than the administration department expects.</p>
        <p id="f15bfe61-6d4d-4015-88b7-03c5da753716" class="">These are hard problems to solve and I will leave it to the reader to think about how to manage these kinds of coordination problems. But if you're technically inclined, I'd recommend reading about <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge/blob/7ec347cc4bec9f8f9f513eb05788ddaec6f34c30/INTERNALS.md">how Automerge deals with these problems for peer-to-peer software</a>.</p>

Things start to get more complicated when we need to keep information up to date in many places and we want to have an audit trail of all changes to a database. But this complexity is <em>essential</em> to solving the problems we addressed.</p>

              <p id="a3c67662-e9a3-4cae-8b78-d1da2ac584cb" class="">For one, there are no database systems I am aware of that efficiently query and evaluate user-generated procedures. This kind of flexibility is essential to build a scalable end-user database application.</p>
              <p id="2703afb4-a5e7-4839-a93f-05e11a6f3e98" class="">Another thing to consider is how information is sharded. In this analogy "sending something in the mail" is effectively saying that there is a boundary between shards. That is, the HR department and the Finance department are in different physical locations. </p>
              <p id="b3e5d8ca-f1da-43cd-830c-67872efe5c4f" class="">When we're building applications for our users, where do all these filing cabinets live? One way to do it is if everyone has their own filing cabinets at home (and some people do). Another way to do it is every service you use keeps records of your information and you have to ask them for it whenever you want to see it. This is currently how most things work in the world: your health records live at your doctor's office, the blueprints for your house live at the building department, and your emails live in a virtual filing cabinet in a Google data center. </p>
              <p id="c03a5f97-f070-4aa1-85a3-2725406ac700" class="">This way of doing things is actually quite convenient for many people ‚Äî they don't need to keep track of their own records at all! On the other hand, it means people are less empowered to build their own filing cabinet systems to manage and automate their life. It also means that their information is less private.</p>
